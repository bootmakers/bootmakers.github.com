As an event approaches, click on the Link in the event column for more information

Our events feature both story meetings and less formal social meetings. At story meetings we present papers, discussions, a quiz about the evening's story, society announcemnets, a musical interlude and light refreshments. There is cost of $12 (or $10 if you preregister). They are held at the Toronto Reference Library. Social meetings are a chance to get to know fellow Sherlockians in a relaxed atmostphere and costs vary depending on the event. This year we are a sponsor for SinS (A Study in Scandal), a four day conference in October, discussing the oftentimes controversial life of Arthur Conan Doyle and the culture of Victoria scandal.

As a member you will receive meeting notices via email. You can preregister by clicking on the link for the event and mailing in the form, or by emailing [bootmaker.meyers@gmail.com](mailto:bootmaker.meyers@gmail.com).  If you are so technically inclined, you can load the <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/qenue5g787ltv9brsvcrtf55rs%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics">google iCal</a> into your scheduling tool of choice.
