About the Bootmakers of Toronto
===============================

The idea of forming a Sherlock Holmes society in Toronto emerged from 'A Weekend With Sherlock Holmes', which was held at the Metro Toronto Central Library in December 1971, which was, at that time, located at College and St. George Streets.

The inaugural meeting was in February 1972, in the Music Room of Hart House at the University of Toronto. It was noted that a 'Mixture of scholarship and whimsy is what is needed at meetings'. That tradition has been well maintained.

The Society adopted the name 'The Bootmakers of Toronto' because Sir Henry Baskerville's boot (stolen to enable the notorious Hound to know his scent) was made in Toronto by a company called Meyers.

Throughout the years, 'The Bootmakers', like most societies, has been affected by the vicissitudes of the economy. The enthusiasm of the members has enabled it to weather the storms.

The Bootmakers are alive and well and enjoying regular meetings, most of which are held at the Toronto Reference Library. Each meeting is devoted to the study of any one of the fifty-six short stories and four novels which comprise the Sherlockian canon.

Activities include scholarly lectures, slide shows, quizzes about the stories, and entertaining musical performances by a lady with a lovely contralto voice, who is accompanied by a gifted musician. Refreshments are served and there is an annual theatrical performance by our resident group of thespians.

The main characteristics of our meeting are the warmth, enthusiasm, and good humour of the members. To any avid Sherlockian reader who isn't a Bootmaker, why not come and join us? A warm welcome awaits you.
