title: The Bootmakers of Toronto - A Sherlockian Society
---

The Sherlock Holmes Society of Canada
-------------------------------------
Sherlock Holmes is one of those rare characters universally recognised by people who have never read a word of their creator's stories. Such is the hold of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's fascinating character on the popular imagination, that Sherlock Holmes societies flourish around the world, including non-English speaking countries.

Since 1972, the Bootmakers of Toronto have been the leading Canadian society for the appreciation and enjoyment of Sherlock Holmes. Please enter our web site to discover more about a world where it is always 1895.

Sherlock Holmes: The Final Adventure
------------------------------------
A play by Steven Dietz

Based on the original 1899 play by William Gillette and Arthur Conan Doyle.

Meyers, Toronto is wondering if there are any Bootmakers interested in
forming a theatre party to see this play on March 5, 2011 at the 2:00 PM
performance. The tickets are $53.11 for seniors and $64.41 for adults. (There
is also a group discount available if we have sufficient numbers.)

Please let me know as soon as possible if you are interested in the
performance, the number in your party (senior or adult), whether you have
room in your car to take passengers or you need a ride and also your contact
information and I will try to arrange an outing with either a lunch or dinner
at a nearby restaurant.

There is an interesting mystery to solve as a contest to promote the play that
you may also wish to check out on their web site: <a href="http://www.grandtheatre.com">www.grandtheatre.com</a>.
